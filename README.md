# Functional programming using purrr package
## Instructor: Wolf Riepl

Our speaker this month is Wolf Riepl, a Radio and TV technician and a Sociologist by training. Since late 2014, Wolf has been working his way into R and never looked back. He now focuses on workshops and training, mostly online since 2020 after many in-person workshops since 2017.
Wolf would be taking us through a comprehensive understanding of the purrr package during the meetup/workshop.

Below is a breakdown of the workshop.
Functional Programming including some purrr MAGIC.
Functional Programming offers powerful tools and can be fun! In this meetup, we'll use MAGIC two-fold: 
- discover the magic of the purrr package to elegantly iterate over 1, 2, or more vectors at the same time; 
- use magic numbers to generate messages from random samples of letters.

Thank you.
